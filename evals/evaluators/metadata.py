"""L0 metadata quality (T2-28, docs/research/langchain_eval_design_kosis.md §3): the table fields the filters decide on.

Fields are `kosis_rag.fields.TableFields` (T2-30, KOS-96), computed with the same functions the filters use, so the
score is about what the filter actually sees, not about a separate copy.

- fill rate: share of tables whose field has a value, over all tables and over the gold tables of the L1 set.
  regions has a third state, None: the table has no administrative class (a national table), which is a value.
- unmapped: measure — the name does not say what it counts (or says 기타); dimensions — breakdown names no question
  breakdown can match, i.e. a breakdown filter can never pick them.
- accuracy: a sample of tables labelled by the evaluation side, field by field (measure exact, dimensions as sets).
